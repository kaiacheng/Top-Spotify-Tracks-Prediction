# Top-Spotify-Tracks-Prediction

According to new MBW analysis of official fiscal numbers, the three major music lables, like Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group and Warner Music Group, they generated $8.34bn revenues from streaming in 2019. Basically, the more popular songs a music label has, the more revenues they can increase. So, my goal of this project is to help the music companies and artists identify which song will be popular. I used classification methods to build the prediction models.
